# chatango-lib
Chatango Library for Python 3.6+

First, Special thanks to Sweets, Linkkg(Megamaster12) and [TheClonerx](https://github.com/linkkg/megach.py)

Based on "megach.py", [linkkg](https://github.com/linkkg/) + "CherryBlossom", [Sweets](https://github.com/sweets/) also she motivate me with async, and LmaoLover for his fork.

##### Things to know (TO DO)
Lib is not finished; there still some bugs. I'll appreciate if someone tell me too.
pm/dm is working, but need some love with the yt frame, and others things.
Rooms works, but at least maybe can have a problem reconnecting. (haven't see it yet.)

**Requirements:**

1. Python 3.6+
2. Setuptools or pip for dependencies (e.g., aiohttp)
3. A little knowledge of asyncio
